# lobster-ui

A visual editor for Lobster workflow files. Built with Next.js, React Flow, and shadcn/ui.

## What it is

`lobster-ui` is a local-first workflow file browser and editor for Lobster workflows. It reads `.lobster`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, and `.json` workflow files, visualizes them in a React Flow canvas, and lets you edit workflow metadata and step fields.

## What it is not

- A workflow executor or agent runner
- A replacement for Lobster/OpenClaw runtime
- A remote SaaS product

## Features

- Discover and list workflows from configured directories
- Visualize workflow steps as nodes in React Flow
- Edit step properties (id, command, stdin, condition, approval)
- Save changes back to disk
- Validate workflows before save
- Dark mode support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lobster-ui.git
cd lobster-ui

### Configuration

By default, lobster-ui looks for workflows in:
- `/Users/sarda/.openclaw/workflows`
- `/Users/sarda/.lobster/workflows`
